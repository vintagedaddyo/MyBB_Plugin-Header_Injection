What it Does
------------
This plugin allows you to insert code in the <head> section of every page of your forum. For example, you may have meta tags you want to include in each page. Instead of having to manually edit the theme (and remember to do it each time you change or update themes), this plugin inserts the code regardless of what theme you are using.

How to Install
--------------
Open the archive and upload the plugin file (HeaderInjectionForMyBB.php) to inc\plugins in your forum folder (via FTP or your web host's control panel). Ex: If your forum folder is http://www.yoursite.com/forum, then the plugin file should be uploaded to http://www.yoursite.com/forum/inc/plugins.

Go to Configuration >> Plugins and look for the "Header Injection For MyBB" entry. Click "Activate."

Go to Configuration >> Settings and look for the "Header Injection For MyBB" entry. Enter the code you want to insert in the <head> section of your forum. For example, meta tags, css links, or javascript. No PHP or MyBB template codes.

How to Uninstall
----------------
Go to Configuration >> Plugins and look for the "Header Injection For MyBB" entry. Click "Deactivate." Then delete the plugin file from the inc\plugins folder. If you deactivate or uninstall the plugin, all settings will be removed. If you reactivate or reinstall the plugin, you will need to re-enter all settings.
